"On the other h, we denounce with righteous indignation  dislike men who are
so beguiled  demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain  trouble that are bound to ensue;  equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil  pain. These cases are perfectly simple  nice  to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled  when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed  every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances  owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated  annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
